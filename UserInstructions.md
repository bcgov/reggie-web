The steps below are for users who have complete the registration process themselves and want to invite other users who cannot because their existing accounts don't meet the prerequisites.

1. Once logged into Reggie, click on the `Invite New User` button and enter the email address of the person you wish to invite to Pathfinder Rocket.Chat.  Please double check that you have provided the correct email address, as Reggie verifies new user based on this email.
1. If the invitation is successfully sent, a green message will be displayed pop up. If not, please contact BC Gov DevHub team for help - something unexpected has happened!

### 3. Receiving and accepting an invitation

If you've received an invitation from an existing Pathfinder Rocket.Chat user, you can accept the invite and complete your own registration following the steps below.  

1. When you receive an email inviting you to join Rocket.Chat, please click on the link.
2. You will be asked to login first, via either `GitHub` or `IDIR`.
  - Please make sure to login to the account that has the same email address associated with it that your invitation was sent to, otherwise validation will fail.
3. Continue and complete your business contact information.
4. Once logged into Reggie, the app will validate your invitation.
  - If the invitation is valid, you will see a button to continue to Rocket.Chat.
  - If not, please ask the person who invited you for another invite, and double check the email address you receive the invitation with is the same as the one associated with the account you log in with.
